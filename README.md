# ERC20 Yul Token

The purpose of this project is to study Yul, Solidity, and the concept of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as a whole. The project includes a contract written in Yul, which implements the ERC20, ERC20Metadata, and ERC20Burnable interfaces. The contract enables token minting only for the owner and simplifies token initialization and testing by implementing it through the Factory contract.

Please note that I cannot guarantee the security of this contract, as it was developed solely for understanding fundamental concepts related to data storage in Storage and Memory, and how a contract works under the hood. Therefore, I **do not** advise using it in production. Additionally, I cannot claim that it is the most efficient in terms of gas usage and algorithms. It simply works.

If you have any suggestions for improving efficiency or anything else, please don't hesitate to contribute
